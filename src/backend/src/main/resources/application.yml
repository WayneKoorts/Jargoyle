  # --- Datasource ---
  # Uncomment and configure when PostgreSQL is available.
  # datasource:
  #   url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jargoyle

  # --- JPA / Hibernate ---
  # Uncomment once the datasource is configured.

  # --- Flyway ---
  # Flyway is on the classpath but will only run when a datasource is configured.
  # Place migration files in src/main/resources/db/migration/

  # --- Security ---
  # A permit-all SecurityFilterChain is defined in SecurityConfig.java so the
  # app starts without OAuth configured. Replace it with proper security rules
  # when authentication is implemented.

  # Disable JPA auto-configuration until a datasource is configured.
  # Remove these exclusions once PostgreSQL is available.
